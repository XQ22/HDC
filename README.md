# HDC (Hotstopper Distribution Centre)
A hotstopper distribution game

## Inspiration
HDC was inspired by a combination of two things: [Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html), a game about a paperclip factory and [Hotstoppers](https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=Hotstopper), a thing used in portable coffee. I found both of these after listening to the [Hello Internet Podcast](https://hellointernet.fm), specifically, episode 92. In fact, this project started on the day of that podcast's release.

## Schedule
Milestone 1 - Have Research system

Milestone 2 - Have Podcast system

Milestone 3 - Beta Release

## Guide

Here's how to play the game, so *spoilers ahoy*.

Step one: Order and deliver enough hotstoppers to hire the telephonist and salesman.

Step two: Order and deliver enough hotstoppers to initiate research.

Step three: Research and research until you discover podcasting

Step four: Begin a hotstopper empire
